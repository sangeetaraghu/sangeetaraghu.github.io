= Use future methods

{VertX} {40-Beta} uses futures for asynchronous operations. 

The following example shows you how a callback was used for asynchronous operations in {VertX} {3x} releases.

----
HttpRequest request = client.get("/resource");

request.send(ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    HttpResponse response = ar.result();
  } else {
    Throwable error = ar.cause();
  }
});
